## What Is This?

An open-source collection of interactive textbooks spanning Math, CS, Physics & Chemistry — organized into five tiers from elementary school to the research frontier.

Every course features:
- **Interactive visualizations** — drag points, adjust sliders, watch animations
- **KaTeX math rendering** — rigorous notation from day one
- **Exercises with hints & solutions**
- **Progress tracking** — saved locally in your browser
- **Zero dependencies** — just open the link and learn
